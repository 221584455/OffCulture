# OffCulture
Off Culture is a modern and inclusive online clothing website designed to serve a diverse customer baseâ€”men, women, boys, and girls. The project was born out of a shared interest in fashion and technology, with the aim of creating a digital retail experience that is visually appealing, easy to use, and accessible across devices.
